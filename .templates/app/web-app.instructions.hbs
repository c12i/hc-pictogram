Notice that this is an empty skeleton for a Holochain web-app, so:

- It won't compile until you add a DNA to it, and then add a zome to that DNA.
- The UI is empty, you'll need to import the appropriate components to the top level app component.

Set up your development environment with:

  cd {{kebab_case app_name}}
  nix develop
  npm install

In order to be able to revert any next scaffolding steps, it is also recommended to commit the skeleton now:

  git add .
  git commit -m "web-app skeleton scaffolded"

To continue scaffolding your app, add a new dna:

  hc scaffold dna

And then add a zome to that dna:

  hc scaffold zome

After that, at any point in time you can start the demo with:

  npm start

You can run the tests with:

  npm test

And you can build the .webhapp production package with:

  npm package
